"This part of the tutorial assumes you have a server that you want to "
"deploy your application to. It gives an overview of how to create the "
"distribution file and install it, but won't go into specifics about what "
"server or software to use. You can set up a new environment on your "
"development computer to try out the instructions below, but probably "
"shouldn't use it for hosting a real public application. See "
":doc:`/deploying/index` for a list of many different ways to host your "
"application."

"When you want to deploy your application elsewhere, you build a "

"*wheel* format, with the ``.whl`` extension. Make sure the wheel library "
"is installed first:"

"Running ``setup.py`` with Python gives you a command line tool to issue "
