" questions about the purpose and goals of the project, and when you "
"should or should not be using it."

msgstr "\"micro\" 是什么意思？"

#: ../../foreword.rst:11
msgid ""
"“Micro” does not mean that your whole web application has to fit into a "
"single Python file (although it certainly can), nor does it mean that "
"Flask is lacking in functionality. The \"micro\" in microframework means "
"Flask aims to keep the core simple but extensible. Flask won't make many "
"decisions for you, such as what database to use. Those decisions that it "
"does make, such as what templating engine to use, are easy to change.  "
"Everything else is up to you, so that Flask can be everything you need "
"and nothing you don't."

#: ../../foreword.rst:19
msgid ""
"By default, Flask does not include a database abstraction layer, form "
"validation or anything else where different libraries already exist that "
"can handle that. Instead, Flask supports extensions to add such "
"functionality to your application as if it was implemented in Flask "
"itself. Numerous extensions provide database integration, form "
"validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies, "
"and more. Flask may be \"micro\", but it's ready for production use on a "
"variety of needs."

msgid ""
"Flask has many configuration values, with sensible defaults, and a few "
"conventions when getting started.  By convention, templates and static "
"files are stored in subdirectories within the application's Python source"
" tree, with the names :file:`templates` and :file:`static` respectively. "
"While this can be changed, you usually don't have to, especially when "
"getting started."

"Once you have Flask up and running, you'll find a variety of extensions "
"available in the community to integrate your project for production. The "

"As your codebase grows, you are free to make the design decisions "
"appropriate for your project.  Flask will continue to provide a very "
"simple glue layer to the best that Python has to offer.  You can "
"implement advanced patterns in SQLAlchemy or another database tool, "
"introduce non-relational data persistence as appropriate, and take "
"advantage of framework-agnostic tools built for WSGI, the Python web "
"interface."

"Flask includes many hooks to customize its behavior. Should you need more"
" customization, the Flask class is built for subclassing. If you are "
"interested in that, check out the :ref:`becomingbig` chapter.  If you are"
" curious about the Flask design principles, head over to the section "
"about :ref:`design`."
