"The request context keeps track of the request-level data during a "
"request. Rather than passing the request object to each function that "
"runs during a request, the :data:`request` and :data:`session` proxies "
"are accessed instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reqcontext.rst:13
msgid ""
"This is similar to the :doc:`/appcontext`, which keeps track of the "
"application-level data independent of a request. A corresponding "
"application context is pushed when a request context is pushed."

msgid "Purpose of the Context"
msgstr "语境的目的"

#: ../../reqcontext.rst:21
msgid ""
"When the :class:`Flask` application handles a request, it creates a "
":class:`Request` object based on the environment it received from the "
"WSGI server. Because a *worker* (thread, process, or coroutine depending "
"on the server) handles only one request at a time, the request data can "
"be considered global to that worker during that request. Flask uses the "
"term *context local* for this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reqcontext.rst:28
msgid ""
"Flask automatically *pushes* a request context when handling a request. "
"View functions, error handlers, and other functions that run during a "
"request will have access to the :data:`request` proxy, which points to "
"the request object for the current request."
msgstr ""

msgid "Lifetime of the Context"
msgstr "语境的生命周期"

#: ../../reqcontext.rst:37
msgid ""
"When a Flask application begins handling a request, it pushes a request "
"context, which also pushes an :doc:`/appcontext`. When the request ends "
"it pops the request context then the application context."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reqcontext.rst:41
msgid ""
"The context is unique to each thread (or other worker type). "
":data:`request` cannot be passed to another thread, the other thread will"
" have a different context stack and will not know about the request the "
"parent thread was pointing to."

"This should typically only happen when testing code that expects an "

"<Flask.test_client>` to simulate a full request. Or you can use "
":meth:`~Flask.test_request_context` in a ``with`` block, and everything "

msgstr "语境如何运作"

#: ../../reqcontext.rst:90
msgid ""
"The :meth:`Flask.wsgi_app` method is called to handle each request. It "
"manages the contexts during the request. Internally, the request and "
"application contexts work as stacks, :data:`_request_ctx_stack` and "
":data:`_app_ctx_stack`. When contexts are pushed onto the stack, the "
"proxies that depend on them are available and point at information from "
"the top context on the stack."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reqcontext.rst:97
msgid ""
"When the request starts, a :class:`~ctx.RequestContext` is created and "
"pushed, which creates and pushes an :class:`~ctx.AppContext` first if a "
"context for that application is not already the top context. While these "
"contexts are pushed, the :data:`current_app`, :data:`g`, :data:`request`,"
" and :data:`session` proxies are available to the original thread "
"handling the request."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reqcontext.rst:104
msgid ""
"Because the contexts are stacks, other contexts may be pushed to change "
"the proxies during a request. While this is not a common pattern, it can "
"be used in advanced applications to, for example, do internal redirects "
"or chain different applications together."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reqcontext.rst:109
msgid ""
"After the request is dispatched and a response is generated and sent, the"
" request context is popped, which then pops the application context. "
"Immediately before they are popped, the :meth:`~Flask.teardown_request` "
"and :meth:`~Flask.teardown_appcontext` functions are are executed. These "
"execute even if an unhandled exception occurred during dispatch."
msgstr ""

msgid "Callbacks and Errors"

"Flask dispatches a request in multiple stages which can affect the "
"request, response, and how errors are handled. The contexts are active "
"during all of these stages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :class:`Blueprint` can add handlers for these events that are specific "
"to the blueprint. The handlers for a blueprint will run if the blueprint "
"owns the route that matches the request."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reqcontext.rst:129
msgid ""
"Before each request, :meth:`~Flask.before_request` functions are called. "
"If one of these functions return a value, the other functions are "
"skipped. The return value is treated as the response and the view "
"function is not called."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reqcontext.rst:134

"raised at any point above."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reqcontext.rst:147
msgid ""
"If an exception is raised before the teardown functions, Flask tries to "
"match it with an :meth:`~Flask.errorhandler` function to handle the "
"exception and return a response. If no error handler is found, or the "
"handler itself raises an exception, Flask returns a generic ``500 "
"Internal Server Error`` response. The teardown functions are still "
"called, and are passed the exception object."

"The teardown callbacks are independent of the request dispatch, and are "

"called even if there is an unhandled exception during dispatch, and for "
"manually pushed contexts. This means there is no guarantee that any other"
" parts of the request dispatch have run first. Be sure to write these "
"functions in a way that does not depend on other callbacks and will not "
"fail."
