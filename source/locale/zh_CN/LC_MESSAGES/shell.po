"One of the reasons everybody loves Python is the interactive shell.  It "
"basically allows you to execute Python commands in real time and "
"immediately get results back.  Flask itself does not come with an "
"interactive shell, because it does not require any specific setup "
"upfront, just import your application and start playing around."

"There are however some handy helpers to make playing around in the shell "
"a more pleasant experience.  The main issue with interactive console "
"sessions is that you're not triggering a request like a browser does "
"which means that :data:`~flask.g`, :data:`~flask.request` and others are "
"not available.  But the code you want to test might depend on them, so "
"what can you do?"

"This is where some helper functions come in handy.  Keep in mind however "
"that these functions are not only there for interactive shell usage, but "
"also for unittesting and other situations that require a faked request "
"context."

"Starting with Flask 0.11 the recommended way to work with the shell is "
"the ``flask shell`` command which does a lot of this automatically for "
"you. For instance the shell is automatically initialized with a loaded "

"The easiest way to create a proper request context from the shell is by "
"using the :attr:`~flask.Flask.test_request_context` method which creates "
"us a :class:`~flask.ctx.RequestContext`:"

msgid ""
"Normally you would use the ``with`` statement to make this request object"
" active, but in the shell it's easier to use the "
":meth:`~flask.ctx.RequestContext.push` and "
":meth:`~flask.ctx.RequestContext.pop` methods by hand:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../shell.rst:55

"From that point onwards you can work with the request object until you "
"call `pop`:"

"By just creating a request context, you still don't have run the code "
"that is normally run before a request.  This might result in your "
"database being unavailable if you are connecting to the database in a "
"before-request callback or the current user not being stored on the "
":data:`~flask.g` object etc."
msgstr ""

"This however can easily be done yourself.  Just call "
":meth:`~flask.Flask.preprocess_request`:"

"might return a response object, in that case just ignore it."

"To shutdown a request, you need to trick a bit before the after request "

msgid ""
"The functions registered as :meth:`~flask.Flask.teardown_request` are "
"automatically called when the context is popped.  So this is the perfect "

"request context (such as database connections)."

"If you like the idea of experimenting in a shell, create yourself a "
