#: ../../testing.rst:353
msgid ""
"This however does not make it possible to also modify the session or to "
"access the session before a request was fired.  Starting with Flask 0.8 "
"we provide a so called “session transaction” which simulates the "
"appropriate calls to open a session in the context of the test client and"
" to modify it.  At the end of the transaction the session is stored.  "
"This works independently of the session backend used::"
