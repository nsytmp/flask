"Flask, like Jinja2 and Werkzeug, is totally Unicode based when it comes "
"to text.  Not only these libraries, also the majority of web related "
"Python libraries that deal with text.  If you don't know Unicode so far, "
"you should probably read `The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer "
"Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets "
"<https://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html>`_.  This part of "
"the documentation just tries to cover the very basics so that you have a "
"pleasant experience with Unicode related things."

"HTTP is based on bytes.  Not only the protocol, also the system used to "
"address documents on servers (so called URIs or URLs).  However HTML "
"which is usually transmitted on top of HTTP supports a large variety of "
"character sets and which ones are used, are transmitted in an HTTP "
"header. To not make this too complex Flask just assumes that if you are "
"sending Unicode out you want it to be UTF-8 encoded.  Flask will do the "
"encoding and setting of the appropriate headers for you."

"The same is true if you are talking to databases with the help of "
"SQLAlchemy or a similar ORM system.  Some databases have a protocol that "

"if you are using non-Unicode characters in your Python files you have to "

"to decode it from the encoding of that file.  Here the old problem that "
